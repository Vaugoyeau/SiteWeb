<h4><strong>Research</strong>: Study of urban-rural gradient influences on reproduction in blue tits (<em>Cyanistes caeruleus</em>) and great tits (<em>Parus major</em>)</h4>
<p><strong>Correlative study with daily monitoring of three reproductive seasons in great tits and blue tits:</strong><br />
* Handling and ringing of adults and nestlings<br />
* Measure of birds’ phenotypes by morphological measurements of mass and skeleton size (tarsus length)<br />
* Sampled eggs, feathers and blood<br />

<p><strong>Analyses in laboratory:</strong> * Animals’ physiology: activation of the immune system by blood sedimentation speed, stress response by quantification of heterophils and lymphocytes on slides and oxidative status by measure of oxidative damage and capacity antioxidant * Coloured phenotype: yellow phenotype by spectrophotometry on feathers in both species and in great tits, size of black breast stripe by pictures * Maternal investment in reproduction: eggs weighed fresh, measure of egg shape and volume, measure of eggshell thickness and colour</p>

A study of phenotypic differences between urban and rural great tit chicks (Parus major)</em>. <strong>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</strong> (Impact factor: unavailable). <strong>5</strong>(79)<br />
Collaboration between CEBC and iEES-Paris allowed us to compare body condition and coloured phenotype in great tits between two pairs of urban and rural populations. Nestlings in urban area were smaller and less yellow than ones in rural areas but had similar size of telomeres.</p></li>
<li><p>VAUGOYEAU M., MEYLAN S. and BIARD C. (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jav.01208/abstract;jsessionid=34C44663807B1B7CA81850CA6E577BE0.f01t03">2017</a>) <em>How does an increase in minimum daily temperatures during incubation influence reproduction in the great tit (Parus major)?</em> <strong>Journal of Avian Biology</strong> (Impact factor: 2.2). <strong>48</strong>: 714-725<br />
In the aim to understand the influence of developmental temperature on phenotypes and physiology of future adults, an experiment of heating nests was doing in forest. Mass of hatchlings in heated nests were higher than mass of hatchlings in control nests during the first three days but the fledging mass were similar between two groups.</p></li>
<li><p>VAUGOYEAU M., ADRIAENSEN F. et al. (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2335/abstract">2016</a>) <em>Interspecific variation in the relationship between clutch size, laying date and urbanization in four species of hole-nesting birds.</em> <strong>Ecology and Evolution</strong> (Impact factor: 2.5). <strong>6</strong>(16): 5907-5920<br />
Timing of breeding and clutch size were analysed in relation to urbanisation in 199 nest box plots across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East for four species of hole-nesters: blue tits, great tits, collared flycatchers and pied flycatchers. The intensity of urbanisation was not correlated with laying date in the four species, while clutch sizes decreased with increasing intensity of urbanisation in both collared and pied flycatchers.</p></li>
<li><p>VAUGOYEAU M., DECENCIERE B. et al. (<a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/13/2106">2015</a>) <em>Is oxidative status influenced by dietary carotenoids and flight ability during winter in great tit (Parus major)?</em> <strong>The Journal of Experimental Biology</strong> (Impact factor: 2.9). <strong>218</strong>(13): 2106-2115<br />
In the aim to understand environmental influences on oxidative status according physical activity on birds, 41 great tits were caught and kept in aviaries under three treatments: physical handicap and dietary supplementation with carotenoids, physical handicap and control diet, and no handicap and control diet. Carotenoid supplementation increased total plasma carotenoid concentrations, decreased feather carotenoid chroma and marginally increased ROM concentration. Handicap increased blood sedimentation only in males but had no clear influence on oxidative stress, which contradicted previous studies. Results were oral presented in 2013 and in a poster in 2014.</p></li>

Pregnant vipers were kept in climatic chamber under five thermal treatments: the first, second or last third of embryogenesis in cold period or all in cold and all in hot environment. Morphological, physiological and behavioural measurements showed that the first third embryogenesis was the most sensitive period of temperatures variations.</p></li>
